# Studio Take-home

As part of our application process, we'd like to see what you can produce by giving you a small assignment. It should take you no more than a few hours to complete the assignment, but any extra polish or features you might want to put in will not go unnoticed.

## The assignment

We would like you to create an invoicing app based on the following design: https://codepen.io/Karthik-Srinivasan/pen/BavymEE

 - [ ] Create a new project and re-implement the above UI in React
 - [ ] Have the invoice detail page call an API (using mockapi.io or similar services) and bind the data to the UI
 - [ ] Add a due date to an invoice
 - [ ] Add save button to the UI and have the button save the invoice to a mocked API

## What we are looking for

 - Think of - Highly reusable components (React components)
 - Think of - Build stages
 - Think of - Error states
 - Think of - Developer centric documentation

#### Extra credit features

 - [ ] Hosted and Demoable

If you have any questions, please ask!
