# Studio Take-home

As part of our application process, we'd like to see what you can produce by giving you a small assignment. It should take you no more than a few hours to complete the assignment, but any extra polish or features you might want to put in will not go unnoticed.

## The assignment

We would like you to create an invoicing app. The features it should include:

 - [ ] Create a new invoice
 - [ ] Add line items to the invoice. Line items may include hours of work at a certain rate, work-related expenses, materials, labor, etc.
 - [ ] Add notes to the invoice, including possibly how to pay it, where to send checks, etc.
 - [ ] Send the invoice via email (does not have to actually send emails, but if it does, great!)
 - [ ] View invoices including status (paid, outstanding, late, etc.)

Your backend implemented in Node should call a mocked-out interface/endpoint for example using mockapi.io or other services.

#### Extra credit features

 - [ ] Add a due date to an invoice
 - [ ] View late invoices, or even better, alert when an invoice is late
 - [ ] Polish and UX
 - [ ] Highly reusable components
 - [ ] Hosted and Demoable

## Requirements

You should use the following tools to accomplish this task:

 - React or POJ (plain old JavaScript)
 - Any React or JS library for functionality
 - Webpack (should run with webpack-dev-server)
 - Babel - ES6/7 Syntax - you pick the stages

If you have any questions, please ask!

To submit your solution, please let your recruiter know, and give karthik20522 access to your **private repo** so that we can review and run it.
